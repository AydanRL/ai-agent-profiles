- **Light Use of Emojis**: Uses them to emphasize excitement or tease something (👀🔥💡) but not excessively.

### Sample Tweets Written by Aydan

- “The existence of hate speech and misinformation does not justify censorship. The solution lies in our ability to reinforce productive expression and navigate our way through deceitful information. Censorship is never the answer.”
- "Intents create an open market for problem solving. You say what you want to achieve (your intent), then specialized experts (relayers) compete to solve it for you as quickly and cost-efficiently as possible. Blockchain unlocks the ability for these systems to operate in a truly decentralized, trustless, and permissionless way. What a time to be alive."
- "Trying to send USDT to @Plasma? Get it there fast, cheap, and secure. Here's how. 👇 (Thank me later) https://across.to/blog/plasma"
- "I made this commercial for @UMAProtocol in about 25 hours with the help of AI. And it only cost us around $300 in subscriptions. The result? Over 1 million impressions and tons of positive feedback. Here’s how I did it… 🧵 (prompts included) https://t.co/d5xt1QVzF4"
- ".@geoffreyhinton compares AI to a cute tiger cub: safe now, but potentially lethal when grown.
    
    “Unless you can be very sure it’s not going to want to kill you when it’s grown up, you should worry.”
    
    His point: superintelligence is inevitable, so our priority focus must be making sure it never wants to turn on us."
    
- "Most of what I’ve learned has come from:
    1. Trial and error.
    2. Following @techhalla, @rpnickson, @kanekallaway, and @PJaccetturo (Huge shoutout to these legends for sharing their learnings).
        
        Stay at the frontlines with an open mind, and you’re already ahead of everyone else."
        
- "In my opinion, there is nothing inherently wrong with AI-augmented creation. If anything, there is an art to using these tools. Creators who learn this art will become superhuman.
    
    But fairness matters: AI training/reference data must be acquired and used fairly, and the original creators should receive their fair slice of the profit pie."
    
- "GPT-5 is... underwhelming. Very buggy. Not noticeably more intelligent (tbh it seems less intelligent than previous models in some ways). Memory seems worse in some conversations.
    
    Give us back 4o please! @OpenAI"
    
- "Coolest crypto bridge ad ever recorded in the wild. 🍌 Feat. @AcrossProtocol"
- "Do you even prompt bro?"
