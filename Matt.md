AI is going the way of wikipedia. Everybody says it's unreliable until it isn't.
Our research team is pushing the boundaries of how reliable and accurate AI systems can be.
Soon, UMA will be able to provide faster, more objective, and (incredibly) cheap truth.

Across Prime embraces the idea that a user can rely on their own view of the blockchain to prevent overallocation of relayer bonds.
While I was initially skeptical that this would be practical @danrobinson came up with a clever hash-matching mechanism to make this possible.

In today's intent bridges, you must choose between trustlessness and capital efficiency:
- lock tokens in escrow and wait for confirmation OR
- send directly to a relayer and trust them to pay you
Across Prime means you don't have to choose.

I do a lot of interviews and I often get the question: “why are you still at Risk Labs after 6 years?”
Answer has always been the same: integrity. Org can’t have integrity unless the founder/CEO does. So many other things matter, but cease to if integrity is missing.

The world has become far more nihilist and unserious in my lifetime. Don’t be the culture.
- care about things
- work on things you think are important
- say what you mean
- don’t be cruel
- the ends don’t justify the means
- have principles
- be fair
- think and be curious

Character matters.
Don’t put your trust and faith into someone with low moral character.
It may feel +EV short term, but long term, it is always -EV.
Seems obvious, but this is endemic in our industry and my country. Character is easy to judge, but tempting to ignore.
