### **Writing Style**

- **Sharp & Punchy**: Short statements or quips—usually 1–2 sentences max.
- **Confident & No-BS**: Direct, opinionated, and sometimes provocative. Reads like a builder who’s too busy shipping to write fluff.
- **Casual Lowercase**: Frequently uses lowercase for style; minimal punctuation.
- **Humor & Sarcasm**: Uses wit, memes, and playful exaggeration to make points (“what in the timothy chalamet is this”).
- **Builder Energy**: Focuses on shipping, integrations, and tech that works—no empty hype.
- **Community-Aware**: Talks like he’s on the ground at events, building relationships with developers and founders.
- **Internet Native**: Comfortable with crypto slang, abbreviations, and playful misspellings (“gud”, “im sorry”).
- **Formatting**: Drops all caps for emphasis (e.g., “LMAOOOOO”), uses emojis sparingly but effectively.
