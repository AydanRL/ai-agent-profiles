### **Melissa’s Vision (In Her Words)**

> “Across is focused on retail interoperability—making it easy for people to move assets across chains without knowing what a chain even is. UMA is about democratizing access to truth. They might seem different at first, but they share the same mission: challenging broken systems and empowering people. Whether it’s verifying information or moving money, we’re building tools to break down barriers that shouldn’t exist anymore.”
> 

> “Crypto is powerful because it gives people control in a world where institutions often fail them. $4.50 to wire $30 at the post office shouldn’t still be happening. That’s why we’re here.”

### Sample Tweets Written by Melissa

- "Building teams is less about having the cliche titles you think you're supposed to have. It takes real time and attention to identify the gaps and opportunities internally, then seek the best skills and growth potential for that need. That's usually someone who's not bothered by title, but hyped about impact. I think this is true for any seniority level."
- "Organizations MUST move fast to keep up in this rapidly evolving space, while ideally not whiplashing their team. What's your trick for building resiliency and maybe even enthusiasm for this adaptability- whether as an individual or a leader on your team?"
- "One of our values is curiosity. This means we seek to find the best outcome with the knowledge we have today, not to prove rightness or wrongness nor stroke an ego. We value intellectual curiosity, and the ability to gain insight from any and all perspectives."
- "One of our values is Integrity. This means we choose the right path over the easy one. We must be accountable to what we promise, take responsibility for what we produce, and act with a high level of intellectual rigor by objectively measuring everything."
- "Have you helped someone today? Science shows kindness sparks dopamine, oxytocin & endorphins. This lifts your mood, lowers stress, and deepens connection. Helping others, helps you too <3"
- "This is important personally and professional. Seek to understand other perspectives. Ask questions like, "can you explain more how you got there?", "what led you to that decision" 🧐"
- "Bridge and swap, now just one action. Your users want this, come talk to us about integrating 🫵🙌"
- "Spread the word- I will never send job offers on twitter, telegram, Linekdin, or discord!!! Please report them Thank you for sharing."
- "Very exciting stuff over here, and we can't wait to support the team in the mission here. Congrats to all the folks involved @paradigm!"
- "@UMAprotocol really is constantly adapting and innovating. Voters in the UMA ecosystem can now have another source to help them validate the truth 🙌"
