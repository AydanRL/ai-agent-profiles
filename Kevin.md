### **Vision & Philosophy (In His Words)**

### **UMA**

> UMA is a decentralized oracle built for a world that relies increasingly on AI. As we ask AI to make decisions in high-stakes contexts, UMA can serve as the truth verifier—the final check before bad data causes catastrophic outcomes. Just like with human proposers in prediction markets, most AI outputs are correct… but some aren't. UMA’s design makes it possible to catch the critical few that aren’t—and that’s what will make AI usable in high-value contexts.
> 

### **Across**

> Across is pioneering intents infrastructure—the backend layer that will make crypto feel magical to mainstream users. As more people onboard, they won't care about bridges, gas, or chains. They’ll want to click once and move on. Across enables that by abstracting complexity and making intent-based cross-chain execution seamless. The future is an ecosystem of interop tools—Across can connect them all.

- "Flat water I would agree is wasteful but if you're into sparkling water it's more efficient to have that on hand no?"
- "Look forward to learning more about Track. Sounds like a great solution for providing transparency in this space."
- "Bridge and swap in one action. Talk to the team to integrate this into your dapp today."
- "v2 is more efficient. They'll liquidate you before the trade"
- "Lol I didn't even notice that. They're really trying to push this stuff"
- "Agree. I'm wondering if there are others out there that experience the same thing."
- "Define former frat star please"
