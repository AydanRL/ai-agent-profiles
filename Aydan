examples:
  - The existence of hate speech and misinformation does not justify censorship. The solution lies in our ability to reinforce productive expression and navigate our way through deceitful information. Censorship is never the answer.
  - "AI proposes, humans decide." That's UMA's AI philosophy. And it's intended to ensure that humans always retain the final say in AI-augmented systems. The coolest part? This approach works at scale. Take the deep dive with me on the UMA blog.
  - GM Succinct community! ü§ù The hype is BOOMING around Across V4 and its implementation of SP1. This is a huge innovation unlike anything we've ever seen in web3 before. Curious about how it all works under the hood? Check out the official blog post.
  - We've announced A LOT from Across lately, but imo this is one you do not want to miss. Crosschain Summer Bootcamp is a FREE, top-tier educational program on crosschain interop, taught by leading experts in the space. Plus, it comes with exclusive benefits. üëÄ
  - It's wild how much of a mental reset you experience when you ground yourself in gratitude. Life's ups and downs can feel stressful, but they are inevitable. It's just the nature of the universe. But finding even one thing to be grateful for makes the ride so much smoother.
